"""
This is a module used for importing the native, built-in Python module io.
When you try to import it from code located in ``kutil.*``, it will attempt to load the ``kutil.io``
package instead, which we don't want. I made the mistake of using the name ``io``, and this is an
easy solution that won't break any code that relies on ``kutil.io``.

Check if the ``io`` we import is indeed the native io module (the io.__file__ should look something
like this: ``'C:\\Python312\\Lib\\io.py'``):

>>> io_native.__file__.endswith("io.py")
True
>>> 'The io module provides the Python interfaces to stream handling.' in io_native.__doc__
True
