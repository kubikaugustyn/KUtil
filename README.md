# KUtil

Kuba's Python Utilities (kutil is intentional - a Czech word).
Made for Python

# Installation

```
mklink /d C:\Python312\Lib\kutil "C:\Users\user\path\to\folder\KUtil\kutil"
```

The command should look something like this (if you want to edit KUtil).

If you don't want to edit it, but only install it, copy the `kutil` folder from the repo directly to your
interpreter's `Lib` folder.
